Weather Study that gathers weather data from API calls from randomly generated longitude and latitudes and plots them in Gmaps to see if the weather is better as you get closer to the equator.  The weather elements used to determine this study included temperature, humidity, cloudiness and windspeed.  

The study began with generating 1500 random longitude and latitudes which were then mapped using citipy library to chart the nearest city to the coordinates.
